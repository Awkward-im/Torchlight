============
Quests block
============
It have block size in savegame files so can be skipped easily
Block consist of two subblocks: finished quests and active quests

4 bytes - (integer) finished list count
x bytes - list of quest IDs. each element is 8 bytes

4 bytes - (integer) active list count.
x bytes - much harder to recognize (flags, variable sizes...)
  4 byte - (Integer) offset to next active quest data from start of Quests block (!!!)
  x bytes - quest data
    8 bytes - (Integer64) quest ID
    8 bytes - (Integer64) -1 usually
    4 bytes - (integer) maybe not integer, don't know.
    4 bytes - (integer) maybe not. -1 usually but can be another in rare cases
    x bytes - several bytes for booleans, (first is for DIALOG count, it placed later)
