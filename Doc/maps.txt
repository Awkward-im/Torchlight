Block "maps"
============
Don't have saved size. So, to skip it, we need to process some data.

4 bytes - (Integer) - usually 0. But can be 1, 2 etc.
          non=-zero usually if same location exists several time in file.
4 bytes - (Float) - current time which user spent on location
4 bytes - (float) - total time spended by user on location
4 bytes - (float) - Unknown. at least, looks like Float. idk what is for
x bytes - (ShortString) - name of location
1 byte  - (byte) looks like "isTown" flag
1 byte  - (byte) idk, 0 usually, "1" just for Sawmill location (Alpha territory)

4 bytes - (integer) X
4 bytes - (integer) Y
x bytes - (X*Y) floats - matrix of 4-bytes Floats. Fog of War? Who knows?

4 bytes - (integer) Unknown. 0 usually

4 bytes - (integer) count
x bytes - list of data (somethig with laoyouts. modders must to know).
          every element is 20 bytes:
    8 bytes - (Integer64) - ID
    4 bytes - (integer) - value
    8 bytes - (Integer64) looks like ID but don't found it in MEDIA folder

4 bytes - (integer) count
x bytes - list of mobs/units. Yes, it can be processed as usual pet block

4 bytes - (integer) list count
x bytes - list of Props:
  4 bytes - (integer) size in bytes
  x bytes - Prop data. Can be read as Items

4 bytes - (integer) list count
x bytes - list of Quest items
  4 bytes - (integer) size in bytes
  x bytes - quest item data

4 bytes - (integer) list count
x bytes - Triggers etc. Each element is 136 bytes length

4 bytes - (integer) list count
x bytes - LAYOUT names. list of ShortString
